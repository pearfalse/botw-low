    - You’re in .glitch(Extended Memory Storage). You can’t save or load, and dying kills your run.
    - Although you can’t reload to fix mistakes, you can place the .item(Travel Medallion) and warp to it to part-reset the world (e.g. if the .enemy(Bokoblins) beat you to the .item(Boko Spear)).

    notes:
    - Despite the presence of .item(fairies), always pick up at least one .item(Spicy Pepper) or .item(Hylian Shroom) to unlock the .tab(Materials) tab.
    - If you run low on fairies, you can .glitch(entangle) a .quote(Drop) prompt from your first weapon onto them five times to grow the stack.
    - You’re free to do the .wb(Magnesis windbomb) this time.
