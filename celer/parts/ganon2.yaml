    comment: Stand in the stone dais when finishing phase 1
    notes: ["This is an AI manip that’ll prevent it starting phase 2 with a teleport."]
- Defeat .enemy(Waterblight Ganon) and .enemy(Fireblight Ganon):
    notes: ["These fights are 100% identical to the first time, including the possible one-shot on .enemy(Fireblight)."]
- Defeat .enemy(Thunderblight Ganon):
    comment: Use the .item(Boomerang) in phase 2
    counter: .split-low(B2)
    split-name: Blights 2
- Defeat .enemy(Calamity Ganon):
    notes:
    - In phase 2, after breaking its shield with a parry, NSJ to activate the .glitch(skew bounce). This gives you enough height to enter bullet time and headshot Calamity.
    - This time though, it’s important not to leave the Calamity fight with a Bow of Light equipped, or it’ll dupe when you arrive at .loc(the DBG fight). Pause buffer with the bow quick menu to unequip before the fight ends.
- Enter the .enemy(Dark Beast Ganon) fight:
    notes:
    - If your .item(Bow of Light) duped, use the dupe and keep it equipped. Do not pick up the intended one.
    - Otherwise, pick up the intended one and use that instead.
- Complete the first .bold(three) phases of the fight:
    notes:
      - If playing with English voice acting, Zelda will say .quote(“We’re so close!”) at the end of phase 3.
- Watch a memory:
