- Defeat .enemy(Waterblight Ganon):
    notes:
    - Do a body shot (.bold(never) a headshot) with the corrupted .item(Royal Guard’s Bow) to do enough damage to immediately end the first phase. This is the general MO with Blight fights in this run.
    - Stand within the stone dais in the centre of the room before finishing phase 2 to set up a .enemy(Fireblight) AI manip.
- Defeat .enemy(Fireblight Ganon):
    notes: "It’s possible to one-shot Fireblight. Shoot its head about 25% in from the edge at eye level and it’ll die before the phase change can happen."
- Defeat .enemy(Thunderblight Ganon), phase 1:
    notes: "If you don’t get a perfect dodge, the .item(Master Sword) has enough durability left to break its shield. Shoot it once with the bow."
- Defeat .enemy(Thunderblight Ganon), phase 2 (Magnesis):
    notes:
    - It’s quicker to use Magnesis here.
    - Once it ragdolls away, immediately kill it with one arrow shot to skip phase 3.
