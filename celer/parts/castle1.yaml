- Defeat .enemy(Waterblight Ganon):
    notes:
    - Do a body shot (.bold(never) a headshot) with the corrupted .item(Royal Guard’s Bow) to do enough damage to immediately end the first phase. This is the general MO with Blight fights in this run.

- Defeat .enemy(Fireblight Ganon):

- Defeat .enemy(Thunderblight Ganon), phase 2 (Magnesis):

    - It’s quicker to use Magnesis here.
