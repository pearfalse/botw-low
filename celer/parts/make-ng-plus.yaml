- Continue any file:

- Skip the opening cutscene without .enemy(killing your run):
    notes:
    - "The .loc(Shrine of Resurrection) assets aren’t fully loaded in when they should be. If you skip the cutscene ASAP, there’s a chance Link’s character model falls into a failsafe trigger underneath the SoR floor for the .item(Sheikah Slate) pickup cutscene. If this happens, your run is .enemy(dead). Here’s the fastest, most consistent way to avoid that:"
    - As soon as you can skip, start pressing the X button .bold(only). You do not need to mash, but without this, the game will take away your ability to skip it at all.
    - When the swirl patterns appear behind Link in the next shot, press +.
    - I’ve never had this strategy fail, but no guarantees here. If in doubt, don’t skip the cutscene at all and take the time loss.
- Wait for the autosave
- Open the options and set them up again:
    notes:
    - One weird side-effect of .glitch(inventory transfer) (strictly speaking, of the .glitch(1970 save)) is that your options will be reset to default. Reapply anything you want.
- Reload the earliest horseback autosave:
